# OOP Practice â€“ C++ Classes and Objects

This repository contains practice exercises for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++.

Each `.cpp` file is an independent example that demonstrates how to define a **class** with attributes and methods, then create and test objects.

---

## ðŸš€ Build & Run Instructions

You can compile and run the examples using **g++**.  
(Use MinGW on Windows, or g++ on Linux/Mac.)

### Example 1 â€“ Student
```bash
g++ student.cpp -o student
./student
```

### Example 2 â€“ Book
```bash
g++ book.cpp -o book
./book
```

### Example 3 â€“ Employee
```bash
g++ Employee.cpp -o employee
./employee
```

### Example 4 â€“ Rectangle
```bash
g++ rectangle.cpp -o rectangle
./rectangle
```

### Example 5 â€“ Circle
```bash
g++ circle.cpp -o circle
./circle
```

### Example 6 â€“ Account
```bash
g++ account.cpp -o account
./account
```

### Example 7 â€“ Laptop
```bash
g++ laptop.cpp -o laptop
./laptop
```

### Example 8 â€“ Course
```bash
g++ Course.cpp -o course
./course
```

### Example 9 â€“ Person
```bash
g++ person.cpp -o person
./person
```

## ðŸ¤– AI Tools Disclosure
I used **ChatGPT** to help:  
- Generate initial class structures (attributes, methods, constructors).  
- Add suggestions for improvements (extra methods like `dau()` in Student, `sdt()` in Person, `checkGPU()` in Laptop).  
- Provide sample comments and explanations of `this` pointer.  

What I did myself:  
- Customized variable names and method names.  
- Added extra functionality (e.g., validation checks, pass/fail status).  
- Wrote my own comments in Vietnamese/English.  
- Tested and fixed compilation errors.  

âœ… All code in this repository was **compiled, run, and understood by me**.  
âœ… AI was used as a **support tool**, not for copy-paste answers.

## ðŸ“‹ Notes
- Each `.cpp` file is independent (no cross-dependencies).  
- All examples were compiled and tested with `g++` version 11+.
